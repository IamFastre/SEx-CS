## Definition

**`SEx`** is a high-level, `C#`-based interpreted programming language made by me for the fun of it.

## Documentation

While there isn't much of documentations around [data types](docs/data-types.md) and [features](docs/feartures-table.md) should be a little enough for now.

## VS Code

There is an under-development visual studio code extension that highlights the syntax right now releasing soon.
